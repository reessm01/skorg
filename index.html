                        <p class="card-text">
                            Skorg is a bastard, and cheerfully acknowledges the fact, going so far to claim he “Ain’t knowin’ who his
                            parents is and don’t got the bloody, black heart to care.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Growing up as an orphan on the streets was rough and Skorg has the scars to prove it. He made his way through
                            back alleys and along the docks the only way he knew how, with his fists, fangs, and any weapon he could get his
                            hands on. Nearly all his natural skills take the form of some type of fighting, from blind to dirty to street.
                            He refers it to as his passion. His other interests being drinking and and more fighting.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            It was on one of these infamous drinking and fighting binges that changed his fortune. A group of young nobles
                            had come slumming to the bad part of the Poor Quarter, a rundown tavern called ‘The Last Haul’. Slurs were
                            hurled, obscene gestures made, and before long Skorg and his pals were attempting to skin and slaughter the
                            intruders.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Skorg ended up in single combat with a rather dexterous young human who wielded what he thought was a metal ass
                            scratcher and toothpick (rapier and stiletto). He had the boy prone on a table, choking the life out of him,
                            when the lad suddenly disappeared. Startled, he turned only to find his opponent standing on the bar. In the
                            next instant, he found a well-crafted, expensive leather boot in his face and all went black. The next he knew,
                            he woke up in a cell.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            And with a twist of fate, and irony, the noble human he had fought was well connected to a local stadium, 'The
                            Bloodhub', that hosted enslaved combat. Slaves regularly fought for their freedom, but none were ever fortunate
                            enough to escape.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Despite Skorg's bad luck he became a fan favorite, which, contrary to intuition, meant an eventual death.
                            Skorg's masters became more fanciful with each of his victories and they had realized he might actually win his
                            freedom. They met one last time to overwhelm him in impossible odds --- and it was expensive!
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            By this time, Skorg was battle wearied and was regularly not given enough time to heal, and he knew his time was
                            about to come. Skorg made his way to the arena when he realized he was up against a familiar goblin motley crew:
                            'The Gobstoppers'. Five in total with a hobgoblin providing direction to the otherwise uncoordinated goblins.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            This time it was personal as there was bad blood between him and them. Skorg was quickly overwhelmed, but he
                            fought nonetheless as if he had a chance, so hard, in fact, that something new happened.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            It was a stray arrow caught his unprotected shoulder that led to him collapsing to one knee exhausted. This was
                            it. The Gobstoppers, now 3 in number, began to close in on him their hobgoblin master commanding them to 'Finish
                            him!'. The strongest remaining goblin raised their sword high for the final blow.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Time slowed for Skorg. He could hear intake of gasps from the crowd. The sword at its apex seemed to come to a
                            complete stop and glistened in the sun. It briefly paused, it ascent was followed by a swift descent -- too fast
                            for the eye to see. Reflex became Skorg's nature and he caught it with a single bloodied hand.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            His eyes shifted from the sword gouging into his right hand, his enormous hand hiding the engraving it was
                            leaving, to its wielder. He remembers the goblin's shocked face and everything went red.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Skorg awoke this time to the wilderness and covered in blood. Nonsequential flashes of memory hit his mind's eye
                            while trying to recall the events before. Nearby a glowing outline of a bear stood nearby and he passed out
                            exhausted at ease sensing it was guarding him.
